# Phansite Mock Up (Update 31/10/2023: [deployed, click here](http://phansite.vercel.app))
Like the description says, this is my attempt in making the front-end for Phansite, a fictional forum web that appears in the JRPG Persona 5. If you're not familiar with the game, Phansite is a forum where people can request for help to the main character (The Phantom Thieves) and talk about the latest scandal/news in Japan. The site itself is made with React and Tailwind CSS. I made this mainly to learn those two, so there's no particular reason on why I picked them. I took a lot of liberties in designing it, so it's not a 1:1 look to the one that's in the game. Dependencies are not included

## Features
There are 3 main features on the web, also based on the game:
1. **poll**: in the game, this is used to gauge interest for the Phantom Thieves. The poll's kinda weird in the game, it defaults to 0% (everyone answers no to the question). So I've set the poll percentage on a certain number, with the 100% being the number of population in Tokyo. Because of this too, the percentage change may look nonexistant upon voting
2. **about page**: brief explanations about the Phantom Thieves. Not too detailed because their identity is unknown to the public.
3. **the forum comment section**: The place where people discuss. Making the dummy comment was tiring, so only the first few were polished well.

## To-Dos
There are more things that I'd love to add to the web, but this is all I can do for the moment.
* Add lazy load
* polish up the rest of the dummy comments' timestamp (a lot of them were still left empty)
* make a "this comment is a request" checkbox and marker
* fix typos
